Mailpile Plugins
================

This is the start of a a plugins directory for Mailpile plugins. 

So far there is only one plugin that actually does anything, and that is "Use The Force, Grapher" which creates nice force directed graphs of your inbox or a search.

There is also the shell of a plugin called MailDeck, which will someday allow users to create TweetDeck style columns of various tags, or conversations.

Really, right now the plugins is not even half baked, it's like an eight baked- we just created this repo and started moving code here so we can see how plugins will take shape.
